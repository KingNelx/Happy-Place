          <h1>Coping With Sad Feelings</h1>
          <p>
            Feeling sad? You're not alone. Everyone feels sad at times.
            Sometimes sad feelings last only a moment. Other times, they last
            a little longer.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s OK to feel sad. But sad feelings don't have to take over your
            mood or ruin your day. You can do things to help yourself feel
            better. When sad feelings ease away, a happier mood can take their
            place.

                I'm lonely. What kind of loneliness? Every kind. I feel
                disconnected. Abandoned. As always. Repetition. So what, my
                love? So what? At first, I just wanted to run away. Now I have
                no where else to run to, nothing to run from. I don't belong
                anywhere, I don't want to go anywhere, I just want to be
                happy.

                We begin from the recognition that all beings cherish
                happiness and do not want suffering. It then becomes both
                morally wrong and pragmatically unwise to pursue only one's
                own happiness oblivious to the feelings and aspirations of all
                others who surround us as members of the same human family.
                The wiser course is to think of others when pursuing our own
                happiness.

          <h3>First, don’t feel bad about feeling sad.</h3>
          When something negative happens in your life, it can seem like your
          world is ending. But instead of suppressing or dismissing your
          emotions—either by distracting yourself or keeping up a good
          front—you should actually embrace them. “All emotions are important
          to experience and have valuable information for us about our lives”
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
          <h3>Embrace your emotions.</h3>
          <p>
            When you avoid sadness altogether, you’re actually doing more harm
            than good. “You can’t heal what you don’t feel”. As uncomfortable
            as it may be, acknowledging and embracing your sadness is actually
            the first step to feeling better. "Instead of running away or
            eating something, drinking something, or yelling at someone,
            breathe it in and embrace it.
          </p>

        <div class="col-2">
          <h3>Find what does make you happy.</h3>
          <p>
            Doing something that'll make you laugh (think: listening to a
            comedy podcast, or even watching a cat video on YouTube).
            "Laughing in response to pain and sadness can be a terrific coping
            mechanism," says Bellace, adding, "Laughter releases endorphins
            similar to exercise, reduces the stress hormone cortisol, and
            increases dopamine (a.k.a. 'the feel-good-hormone')." Of course,
            the grieving process takes time, "so there is no shame in not
            wanting to laugh for a while," assures Bellace.

          <h3>Spend time in nature.</h3>
          <p>
            Rockmore recommends experiencing the outdoors with all five of
            your senses, which she calls “behavioral activation.” Pay
            attention to what you see, feel, hear, smell and possibly taste in
            nature, and it may help you out of your slump. “Getting out of
            hibernation and being active stimulates the nervous system and
            gives people the opportunity to see beauty in the world,” says
            Rockmore.
